# BaB Game Simulator

This program is a Python implementation of the bustabit game simulator, which is used to simulate the games on the BustAbit online gambling platform. The original code for this project was written in JavaScript by a [user](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=389331) on the BitcoinTalk forum, and this is a Python adaptation of that code.

## Installation

To use this program, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download and install the latest version of Python from the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Once you have installed Python, you can download the source code for this program from the GitHub repository at https://github.com/username/BustAbit-simulator. You can either download the code as a ZIP file and extract it to a local directory, or you can clone the repository using Git:

```
git clone https://github.com/Spring-0/BaB-simulator.git
```

## Usage

The program will prompt you to enter a game seed value. This seed value is used to generate a hash chain, which is used to generate random numbers for the game outcomes.

After you enter the seed value, the program will simulate a series of games using the hash chain, and it will print out the game results for each round. The results include the game ID, the hash value used for the round, and the game outcome as a multiplier of the original bet amount.
